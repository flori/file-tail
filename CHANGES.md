## 2008-04-07 v1.0.3

* Danny Colligan <danny.colligan@sendori.com> reported a memory leak in long
  running scripts using file-tail. I changed file-ta il to only use block.call,
  which seems to improve the memory behaviour. I am still not sure, where the
  problem actually stems f rom, though.

## 2007-04-19 v1.0.2

* make_doc.rb was missing from the source archive. Thanks to Rick Ohnemus
  <rick.ohnemus@systemware.com> for reporting it.

## 2007-04-19 v1.0.1

* Bugfix: File::Tail::Logfile#open with block, now closes the file like
  File#open does. Found by Alex Doan <alex.doan@wachovia. com>,
  ruby-talk:248383.

## 2007-03-30 v1.0.0

* Bugfix: David.Barzilay@swisscom.com reported, that file tails may skip some
  log file lines, after rotating it. I think, that I fixed that problem.
* Added a after_reopen callback as well, that is called after reopening of the
  tailed file has occured.
* Removed rewind/wind methods even earlier than planned: I placed the
  deprecation warning for rewind method in File instead of File::Tail, which
  caused rewind to stop working completely after loading file/tail. Duh! I
  blame vim's matchit, because it jump ed to the wrong end keyword.

## 2007-02-08 v0.1.4

* Renamed rewind method to backward, and wind method to forward, because
  someone already had the good idea to name a method IO# rewind, which was
  overwritten by the mixed in File::Tail methods. The old methods are now
  deprecated and will be removed in a n ew 0.2.x version of the library.
* Added a bit more of documentation.

## 2005-08-20 v0.1.3

* Applied LOAD_PATH patch by Daniel Berger, binary mode changes were already in
  the CVS. Seemed to be like cheating to me, thou gh. ;)
* Skipping one windows test for the moment, too. Sigh!

## 2004-09-30 v0.1.2

* First Rubyforge release
* Added Rakefile
* Supports gem build now.

## 2004-09-01 v0.1.1

* Josh Endries <josh@endries.org> found a bug that caused File::Tail to
  malfunction on FreeBSD. Hotfix: Use a side effect of se ek to clearerr the
  tailed file handle after EOFError has been raised.

## 2004-04-13 v0.1.0

* API documentation with rdoc.
* return_if_eof attribute added.
* Added array return mode for finite tail call without block given.
* install.rb now uses ruby version site_dir.
* Some code and directory structure cleanup.

## 2002-08-02 v0.0.2

* Heavy refactoring, more and smaller methods and expception handling
* Added check for inode and device equality of files as suggested by James
  F.Hranicky <jfh@cise.ufl.edu> and Curt Sampson <cjs@ cynic.net> to cover
  remove rotation
* If filesize shrinks suddenly, File::Tail assumes that copy and truncate
  rotation has happend: The file is reopened and every new line is handled.
* NFS-Fix: Errno::ESTALE is caught.
* wind added to skip the first n lines, as James F.Hranicky's suggested and
  changed name of last-method to rewind, because I li ked his method names
  better than mine ;)
* Renamed next to tail either.
* The API has changed - but I think very few people care at the moment.
* Lots of tests added.

## 2002-07-30 v0.0.1

* Initial Release
