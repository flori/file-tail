2008-04-07 * 1.0.3 * Danny Colligan <danny.colligan@sendori.com> reported a
                     memory leak in long running scripts using file-tail. I
                     think this might be a ruby related problem, which is
                     caused/aggravated by using yield after having &block
                     parameter in a method. I changed file-tail to only use
                     block.call, which seems to improve the memory behaviour. I
                     am still not sure, where the problem actually stems
                     from, though.
2007-04-19 * 1.0.2 * make_doc.rb was missing from the source archive. Thanks to
                     Rick Ohnemus <rick.ohnemus@systemware.com> for reporting it.
2007-04-19 * 1.0.1 * Bugfix: File::Tail::Logfile#open with block, now closes
                     the file like File#open does. Found by Alex Doan
                     <alex.doan@wachovia.com>, ruby-talk:248383.
2007-03-30 * 1.0.0 * Bugfix: David.Barzilay@swisscom.com reported, that file
                     tails may skip some log file lines, after rotating it. I
                     think, that I fixed that problem.
                     I added a after_reopen callback as well, that is called
                     after reopening of the tailed file has occured.
                   * Removed rewind/wind methods even earlier than planned: I
                     placed the deprecation warning for rewind method in File
                     instead of File::Tail, which caused rewind to stop working
                     completely after loading file/tail. Duh! I blame vim's
                     matchit, because it jumped to the wrong end keyword.
2007-02-08 * 0.1.4 * Renamed rewind method to backward, and wind method to
                     forward, because someone already had the good idea to name
                     a method IO#rewind, which was overwritten by the mixed in
                     File::Tail methods. The old methods are now deprecated and
                     will be removed in a new 0.2.x version of the library.
                   * Added a bit more of documentation.
2005-08-20 * 0.1.3 * Applied LOAD_PATH  patch by Daniel Berger, binary mode
                     changes were already in the CVS. Seemed to be like cheating
                     to me, though. ;)
                   * Skipping one windows test for the moment, too. Sigh!
2004-09-30 * 0.1.2 * First Rubyforge release
                   * Added Rakefile
                   * Supports gem build now.
2004-09-01 * 0.1.1 * Josh Endries <josh@endries.org> found a bug
                     that caused File::Tail to malfunction on FreeBSD.
                     Hotfix: Use a side effect of seek to clearerr the tailed
                     file handle after EOFError has been raised.
2004-04-13 * 0.1.0 * API documentation with rdoc.
                   * return_if_eof attribute added.
                   * Added array return mode for finite tail call without block
                     given.
                   * install.rb now uses ruby version site_dir.
                   * Some code and directory structure cleanup.
2002-08-02 * 0.0.2 * Heavy refactoring, more and smaller methods
                     and expception handling
                   * Added check for inode and device equality of files
                     as suggested by
                     James F.Hranicky <jfh@cise.ufl.edu> and
                     Curt Sampson  <cjs@cynic.net> to cover remove
                     rotation
                   * If filesize shrinks suddenly, File::Tail assumes that
                     copy and truncate rotation has happend: The file
                     is reopened and every new line is handled.
                   * NFS-Fix: Errno::ESTALE is caught.
                   * wind added to skip the first n lines, as
                     James F.Hranicky's suggested and changed
                     name of last-method to rewind, because I liked
                     his method names better than mine ;)
                   * Renamed next to tail either.
                   * The API has changed - but I think very few people
                     care at the moment.
                   * Lots of tests added.
2002-07-30 * 0.0.1 * Initial Release
